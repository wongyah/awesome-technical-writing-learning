  <li>Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences</li>
  <li>Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback</li>
  <li>Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience</li>

<p>Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our behavior standards and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p>

<p>Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

Examples of representing our project and community include using our official project email address, posting via our official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.</p>
