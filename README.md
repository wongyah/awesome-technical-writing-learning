## Technical Writing

If you are completely new to technical writing, the following **üîî courses** are the best start points for you:

- [Google Technical Writing Courses for Engineers](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing) - A practical technical writing course for beginners, featuring examples and metaphors that all programmers are familiar with.
    - [Google Technical Writing Courses for Engineers](https://developers.google.cn/tech-writing) (China)

## Technical Illustrations

A picture is worth a thousand words.

High-tech industries usually rely heavily on technical illustrations in their technical documentations, such as manufacturing, automotive, aerosapce, and defense. But unfortunately, there are few resources available ü§ì.

## Authoring Formats

Going with the trend of Docs as Code, more and more organizations and their technical writers have ditched word processors and switched to markup languages.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language created by John Gruber in 2004. It has become a commonly used markup language to write technical documentations, especially those software documentations that host in GitHub or GitHub-like platforms.

If you are completely new to Markdown, the following **üìî guide** is the best start point for you:

- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - A concise, barebones guide for Markdown beginners.
- [John Gruber's Markdown Documentation](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

Now, you have known a bit of Markdown üëè.  It is easy-to-read, easy-to-write, and easy-to-learn, isn't it üòé?

Can't wait to try it out? Just adopt a **‚úíÔ∏è Markdown editor**, then you are ready üí™!

- [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) - A concise in-browser Markdown editor, which can create new files, export the files to Markdown, HTML, or PDF, synchronize with GitHub, Google Drive, or Dropbox repositories, etc.
- [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) - An in-browser Markdown editor with rich functions, which can create new files or new folders, export the files to Markdown or HTML, synchronize with GitHub, Google Drive, or Dropbox accounts, etc.
- [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - A code editor developed by Microsoft, with built-in Markdown preview and many Markdown extentions.

    - [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://github.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced#readme) - An extention to enrich Markdown features in Atom and VS Code, featuring the integration of Pandoc.

If you go deep into Markdown, you will find [the controversy over it](https://ericholscher.com/blog/2016/mar/15/dont-use-markdown-for-technical-docs/).

As Markdown got popular, more and more Markdown parsers appeared. However, Markdown has no well-accepted standard untill now. The Markdown syntax in each parser is to some extent different from others.

As a result, every time you choose a new Markdown tool, you had better read through its **üìô user manual or documentation** to know exactly what Markdown syntax it supports.

- [GitHub Docs: Writing on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) - Basic Markdown syntax supported on GitHub.

### reStructuredText

reStructuredText is a lightweight markup language that is more well-defined compared to [Markdown](#markdown) and widely used for Python documentation. 

If you are completely new to reStructuredText, the following **üìî introductions and tutorials** are the best start points for you:

- [Introduction to reStructuredText](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/reStructuredText/)
- [A ReStructuredText Primer](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/rst/quickstart.html) - An informal introduction to reStructuredText written by Richard Jones.
- [reStructuredText Primer](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) - A brief introduction to reStructuredText in Sphinx documentation.

Now, you have known a bit of reStructuredText üëè. Just adopt a **‚úíÔ∏è reStructuredText editor**, then you can try it out üçß!

### DITA

DITA is an open source standard for creating topic-based strcutured technical documentations, which was originally created by IBM and was donated to OASIS in 2005. 

It was initially spread to high-tech companies like Adobe, Siemens, and Kone, and then become more and more popular in all industries.

If you are completely new to DITA, the following **üîî courses and tutorials** are the best start points for you:

- [LearningDITA](https://learningdita.com/) - Nine game-based courses for DITA beginners, developed and maintained by Scriptorium.
- [DITA for the Impatient](https://www.xmlmind.com/tutorials/DITA/) - A short DITA tutorial to teach the basics of DITA, developed by Hussein Shafie at XMLmind Software.

Now, you have known a bit of DITA üëè. It's time to practice üíÉüï∫!

That said, DITA is a bit complicated. Adopt a [DITA-aware XML editor](https://www.ditawriter.com/list-of-dita-optimized-editors/) first, in case you are trapped in the tremendous DITA elements. Then, keep a **üìô book of DITA best practices** at hand for reference at any time.

- [DITA Best Practices: A Roadmap for Writing, Editing, and Architecting in DITA](https://www.amazon.com/DITA-Best-Practices-Roadmap-Architecting/dp/0132480522) - A practical book about how to write effective technical information in DITA, published in 2011 by IBM Press (not a free resource).
- [The DITA Style Guide: Best Practices for Authors](https://www.oxygenxml.com/dita/styleguide/) - A style guide written in DITA 1.1 by Tony Self.

You can use DITA to improve your own technical documentation. If you don't have such resources, pick one of **üìî open source sample manuals written in DITA** to see how it was written and think how to improve it.

- [DITA Mini Manual](https://github.com/flicstar/DITA-Mini-Manual#readme) - A 1960s Mini owner's manual rewritten in DITA.

- [DITA Glossary Example](https://github.com/DITAWriter/dita_glossary_example#readme) - A book named *On Yacht Sailing* rewritten in DITA to demontrate how to implement glossories in DITA.

DITA has much more elements than [Markdown](#markdown) and [reStructuredText](#restructuredtext). If you encounter soemthing unknown, resort to **üìò official specifications**.

- [DITA Version 1.3](https://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/dita/v1.3/) - The latest official specifications for DITA, which was released on Jun 19, 2018.

### S1000D

S1000D is an international specification for procurement and production of technical publications, which was initially developed for military aerospace industries and spread to various civil and military aeroamphibious equipments later.

S1000D is the most complicated standard for technical documentations. That means, there are rare free resources for self-study.

Here are the **üìÅ official specifications and implementations in specific industries**.

## Text Automatic Processing

Equipping yourself with some programming skills will enable you to complete some really cool jobs, such as automating workflow and batch modifying.

### Regular Expression

A regular expression (regex) is a pattern that the regex engine can use to find or match substrings. Regex is extremely useful in finding and replacing texts or strings in text files.

If you are completely new to regex, the following **üìô tutorial** is the best start point for you:

- [Regular Expressions: The Complete Tutorial](https://gotellilab.github.io/Bio381/Scripts/Feb07/RegularExpressionsTutorial.pdf) - An easy-to-understand and practical book for regex beginners written by Jan Goyvaerts.
