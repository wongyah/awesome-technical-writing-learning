## Technical illustrations

A picture is worth a thousand words.

High-tech industries usually rely heavily on technical illustrations in their technical documentation, such as manufacturing, automotive, aerospace, and defense. But unfortunately, there are few resources available ü§ì.

- [Technical Illustration in the 21st Century: A Primer for Today's Professionals](https://docslib.org/doc/3602588/technical-illustration-in-the-21st-century-a-primer-for-todays) - White paper produced by Bettina Giemsa at PTC.
- [The State of Technical Illustration and Documentation](https://www.coreldraw.com/en/learn/webinars/ebook-state-of-tech-design/) - Survey report on technical illustration and documentation market, conducted by Corel in 2022.

Technical illustrators used to create technical illustrations using Adobe Illustrator or CAD. However, **üíª software designed specially for technical illustrations** is becoming more and more popular in these days.

- [Arbortext IsoDraw Data Sheet](https://www.ptc.com/-/media/Files/PDFs/Products/Arbortext/2019-datasheet/IsoDraw.pdf) and [Arbortext IsoDraw Online Help](https://support.ptc.com/help/isodraw/r7.3/en/index.html) - Commercial software for technical illustrations, developed by PTC.

## Authoring formats

Going with the trend of Docs as Code, more and more organizations and their technical writers have ditched word processors and switched to markup languages.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language created by John Gruber in 2004. It has become a commonly used markup language to write technical documentations, especially those software documentations that host in GitHub or GitHub-like platforms.

If you are completely new to Markdown, the following **üìî guide** is the best starting point for you:

- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - Concise, barebones guide for Markdown beginners.
- [John Gruber's Markdown Documentation](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

Now, you know a bit about Markdown üëè.  It is easy-to-read, easy-to-write, and easy-to-learn, isn't it üòé?

Can't wait to try it out? Just adopt a **‚úíÔ∏è Markdown editor**, then you are ready üí™!

- [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) - In-browser Markdown editor. It can create new files, export files to Markdown, HTML, or PDF, synchronize with GitHub, Google Drive, or Dropbox repositories, etc.
- [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) - In-browser Markdown editor with rich functions. It can create new files or folders, export the files to Markdown or HTML, synchronize with GitHub, Google Drive, or Dropbox accounts, etc.
- [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Code editor developed by Microsoft, with built-in Markdown preview and many Markdown extensions.
    - [Markdown All in One](https://github.com/yzhang-gh/vscode-markdown/#readme) - An extension to enrich Markdown features in VS Code, such as automatic creation of table of contents, auto completions, printing Markdown files to HTML.
    - [Markdown Table Maker](https://github.com/kaisugi/vscode-markdown-tablemaker?tab=readme-ov-file#readme) - An extension to generate Markdown tables in an easy and intuitive way.

    - [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://github.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced#readme) - An extension to enrich Markdown features in Atom and VS Code, featuring the integration of Pandoc.

If you go deeper, you will find [the controversy over Markdown](https://ericholscher.com/blog/2016/mar/15/dont-use-markdown-for-technical-docs/).

As Markdown got popular, more and more Markdown parsers appeared. However, Markdown has no well-accepted standard untill now. The Markdown syntax in each parser is to some extent different from others.

As a result, whenever you select a new Markdown tool, you must read through its **üìô user manual or documentation** to know exactly what Markdown syntax it supports.

- [GitHub Docs: Writing on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) - Basic Markdown syntax supported on GitHub.

- [reStructuredText Primer](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) - Brief introduction to reStructuredText in Sphinx documentation.

Now, you know a bit about reStructuredText üëè. Just adopt a **‚úíÔ∏è reStructuredText editor**, then you can try it out üçß!

### DITA

DITA is an open source standard for creating topic-based strcutured technical documentations, which was originally created by IBM and was donated to OASIS in 2005. 

DITA was initially spread to high-tech companies like Adobe, Siemens, and Kone, and then become more and more popular in all industries.

If you are completely new to DITA, the following **üîî courses and tutorials** are the best starting points for you:

- [LearningDITA](https://learningdita.com/) - Nine game-based courses for DITA beginners, developed and maintained by Scriptorium.
- [DITA for the Impatient](https://www.xmlmind.com/tutorials/DITA/) - Short DITA tutorial to teach the basics of DITA, developed by Hussein Shafie at XMLmind Software.

Now, you know a bit about DITA üëè. It's time to practice üíÉüï∫!

That said, DITA is a bit complicated. Adopt a [DITA-aware XML editor](https://www.ditawriter.com/list-of-dita-optimized-editors/) first, in case you are trapped in the tremendous DITA elements. Then, keep a **üìô book of DITA best practices** at hand for reference at any time.

- [The DITA Style Guide: Best Practices for Authors](https://www.oxygenxml.com/dita/styleguide/) - Written in DITA 1.1 by Tony Self.

You can use DITA to improve your own technical documentation. If you don't have such resources, pick one of **üìî open source sample manuals written in DITA** to see how it was written and think how to improve it.

- [DITA Mini Manual](https://github.com/flicstar/DITA-Mini-Manual#readme) - Mini owner's manual that published in 1960s rewritten in DITA.

- [DITA Glossary Example](https://github.com/DITAWriter/dita_glossary_example#readme) - A book named *On Yacht Sailing* rewritten in DITA to demontrate how to implement glossories.

DITA has much more elements than Markdown and reStructuredText. If you encounter soemthing unknown, resort to **üìò official specifications**.

- [DITA Version 1.3](https://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/dita/v1.3/) - The latest official specifications for DITA, which was released on Jun 19, 2018.

### S1000D

S1000D is an international specification for procurement and production of technical publications, which was initially developed for military aerospace industries and spread to various civil and military aeroamphibious equipments later.

S1000D is the most complicated standard for technical documentations. That means, there are rare free resources for self-study.

Here are the **üìÅ official specifications and implementations in specific industries**.

## Text processing

Equipping yourself with some programming skills will enable you to complete some really cool jobs, such as automating workflow and batch modifying.

### Regular expressions

A regular expression (regex) is a pattern that the regex engine can use to find or match substrings. Regexes is extremely useful in finding and replacing texts or strings in text files.

If you are completely new to regexes, the following **üìô tutorial** is the best starting point for you:

- [Regular Expressions: The Complete Tutorial](https://gotellilab.github.io/Bio381/Scripts/Feb07/RegularExpressionsTutorial.pdf) - Easy-to-understand and practical book for regex beginners.

Use an **üíª online tool** to experiment the regexes in the tutorial. It will make your studying easy and interesting.
