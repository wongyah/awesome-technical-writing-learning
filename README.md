## Technical illustrations

A picture is worth a thousand words.

High-tech industries usually rely heavily on technical illustrations in their technical documentation, such as manufacturing, automotive, aerospace, and defense. But unfortunately, there are few resources available ü§ì.

- [Technical Illustration in the 21st Century: A Primer for Today's Professionals](https://docslib.org/doc/3602588/technical-illustration-in-the-21st-century-a-primer-for-todays) - White paper produced by Bettina Giemsa at PTC.
- [The State of Technical Illustration and Documentation](https://www.coreldraw.com/en/learn/webinars/ebook-state-of-tech-design/) - Survey report on technical illustration and documentation market, conducted by Corel in 2022.

Technical illustrators used to create technical illustrations using Adobe Illustrator or CAD. However, **üíª software designed specially for technical illustrations** is becoming more and more popular in these days.

- [Arbortext IsoDraw Data Sheet](https://www.ptc.com/-/media/Files/PDFs/Products/Arbortext/2019-datasheet/IsoDraw.pdf) and [Arbortext IsoDraw Online Help](https://support.ptc.com/help/isodraw/r7.3/en/index.html) - Commercial software for technical illustrations, developed by PTC.

## Authoring formats

Going with the trend of Docs as Code, more and more organizations and their technical writers have ditched word processors and switched to markup languages.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language created by John Gruber in 2004. It has become a commonly used markup language to write technical documentations, especially those software documentations that host in GitHub or GitHub-like platforms.

If you are completely new to Markdown, the following **üìî guide** is the best starting point for you:

- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - Concise, bare-bones guide for Markdown beginners.
- [John Gruber's Markdown Documentation](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

Now, you know a bit about Markdown üëè.  It is easy-to-read, easy-to-write, and easy-to-learn, isn't it üòé?

Can't wait to try it out? Just adopt a **‚úíÔ∏è Markdown editor**, then you are ready üí™!

- [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) - In-browser Markdown editor. It can create new files, export files to Markdown, HTML, or PDF, synchronize with GitHub, Google Drive, or Dropbox repositories, etc.
- [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) - In-browser Markdown editor with rich functions. It can create new files or folders, export the files to Markdown or HTML, synchronize with GitHub, Google Drive, or Dropbox accounts, etc.
- [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Code editor developed by Microsoft, with built-in Markdown preview and many Markdown extensions.
    - [Markdown All in One](https://github.com/yzhang-gh/vscode-markdown/#readme) - An extension to enrich Markdown features in VS Code, such as automatic creation of table of contents, auto completions, printing Markdown files to HTML.
    - [Markdown Table Maker](https://github.com/kaisugi/vscode-markdown-tablemaker?tab=readme-ov-file#readme) - An extension to generate Markdown tables in an easy and intuitive way.

    - [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://github.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced#readme) - An extension to enrich Markdown features in Atom and VS Code, featuring the integration of Pandoc.

If you go deeper, you will find [the controversy over Markdown](https://ericholscher.com/blog/2016/mar/15/dont-use-markdown-for-technical-docs/).

As Markdown got popular, more and more Markdown parsers appeared. However, Markdown has no well-accepted standard until now. The Markdown syntax in each parser is to some extent different from others.

As a result, whenever you select a new Markdown tool, you must read through its **üìô user manual or documentation** to know exactly what Markdown syntax it supports.

- [GitHub Docs: Writing on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) - Basic Markdown syntax supported on GitHub.

- [kramdown Quick Reference](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html) and [kramdown Syntax](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html) - Markdown syntax of kramdown, which is the default Markdown parser for Jekyll.

If you want to explore more resources about Markdown, see [Awesome Markdown](https://github.com/BubuAnabelas/awesome-markdown#readme).

### reStructuredText

reStructuredText is a lightweight markup language that is more well-defined compared to Markdown and widely used for Python documentation. 

If you are completely new to reStructuredText, the following **üìî introductions and tutorials** are the best starting points for you:

- [reStructuredText Primer](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) - Brief introduction to reStructuredText in Sphinx documentation.

Now, you know a bit about reStructuredText üëè. Just adopt a **‚úíÔ∏è reStructuredText editor**, then you can try it out üçß!

- [Online reStructuredText editor](https://rsted.info.ucl.ac.be/)
- [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Code editor developed by Microsoft.

### DITA

DITA is an open source standard for creating topic-based structured technical documentations, which was originally created by IBM and was donated to OASIS in 2004. 

DITA was initially spread to high-tech companies like Adobe, Boeing, Siemens, and Nokia, and then become more and more popular in all industries.

## Text processing

Equipping yourself with some programming skills will enable you to complete some really cool jobs, such as automating workflow and batch modifying.

### Regular expressions

A regular expression (regex) is a pattern that the regex engine can use to find or match substrings. Regex is extremely useful in finding and replacing texts or strings in text files.

If you are completely new to regex, the following **üìô tutorial** is the best starting point for you:

- [Regular Expressions: The Complete Tutorial](https://gotellilab.github.io/Bio381/Scripts/Feb07/RegularExpressionsTutorial.pdf) - Easy-to-understand and practical book for regex beginners.

Use an **üíª online tool** to experiment the regex in the tutorial. It will make your studying easy and interesting.

- [RegExr](https://regexr.com/) - Online tool to learn, build and test regexes.
- [Pyrexp](https://pythonium.net/regex) - Online tool to visualize, test and debug Python regexes.

> [!TIP]
> You can also use a text editor with support for regex, such as VS Code.

Take a **üìî cheat sheet or quick reference** at hand to check the regex syntax at any time:

- [Regular Expression Language: Quick Reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-language-quick-reference) - Quick reference for regex from Microsoft.

### XSL

XSL (Extensible Stylesheet Language) is a styling language for XML. It consists of three parts: XSLT, XPath, and XSL-FO.

**XSLT** (XSL Transformations) is a language for transforming XML documents. It is widely used in many purposes other than stylesheets, like transforming from one XML language to another, generating HTML pages from XML documents, etc.
